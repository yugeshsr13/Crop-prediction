# Crop Recommendation System using Machine Learning

This project is designed to assist farmers in making informed decisions about crop cultivation based on climatic conditions and soil properties. By utilizing the power of K-Means Clustering and Logistic Regression algorithms, this system provides accurate crop recommendations, thereby enhancing agricultural practices.

## Introduction

Modern agriculture heavily relies on factors such as soil composition, temperature, humidity, pH levels, and rainfall patterns. This project harnesses the potential of K-Means Clustering to group crops with similar needs and uses Logistic Regression for effective crop classification, resulting in a reliable and efficient Crop Recommendation System.

## Project Components

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The provided dataset is prepared through cleaning and organization to facilitate analysis.

2. **K-Means Clustering**: K-Means is implemented to cluster crops with similar attributes. The ideal number of clusters is identified using the "Elbow Method."

3. **Crop Classification**: A Logistic Regression model is trained to classify crops based on input features.

4. **User Interaction**: Users can input specific climatic and soil conditions to receive accurate crop recommendations.

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Gather crop data and create a structured dataset.

2. **Preprocessing**: Clean and organize the dataset for further analysis.

3. **K-Means Clustering**: Apply K-Means to cluster crops and determine the optimal number of clusters.

4. **Logistic Regression**: Train the Logistic Regression model for crop classification.

5. **User Recommendations**: Input relevant conditions to obtain personalized crop suggestions.
